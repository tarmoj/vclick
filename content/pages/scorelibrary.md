Here are several vClick scores created for the system. Some of them are public -  please feel free to use, study, improve them -  others are private. From the private scores you can find short excerpts to try out the functionality or learn how they are done. If you need the full score, please contact me and I will connect you with the "owner" of the score.

See more about score file syntax etc [here](score-files.html).
