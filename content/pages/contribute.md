## Test-Report-Test

The best support to the project is to give feed-back. I appreciate highly the time you put into writing bug repports or just emaling me.

If you have any problems, suggestions or find bugs, the best way to let know is to use the
[Issue tracker](https://github.com/tarmoj/vclick/issues) - click "New issue" and write about your problem. 

OR

just end an [e-mail](mailto:trmjhnns@gmail.com)

Please let know **ALWAYS** :

- vClick program (server/client) and its version (like _server, version 0.1.1_)

- device it is running on (laptop/iphone/android etc, its model, if necessary) -  like "Samsung Galaxy Prime"

- your operating system, and if you know if it is 32-bit or 64-bit (like _Windows 7 Pro 64 bit_ or _iOs 9.2_ )

- try to describe the problem as exactly as you can, avoid messages in style "my vClick system does not work".
