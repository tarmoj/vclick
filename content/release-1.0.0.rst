`vClick <pages/about.html>`_ is a free wireless visual click-track system for musicians.   


It is supposed to be fully functional and ready to use, including multichannel messages (different signals to different players), nevertheless don't forget that it is issued under General Public Licence that tells:

**vClick Client for iOs** can now be installed from `App Store <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vclick-client/id1247820434?mt=8>`_

*Currently the App Store install is disabled since my developer license expired and I have personally no interest to pay any more for Apple. If you care, please consider a donation I could renew the devloper account. Or use another operating system.*
